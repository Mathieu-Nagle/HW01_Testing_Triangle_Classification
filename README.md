# HW01_Testing_Triangle_Classification
#### What challenges did you encounter with this assignment, if any? 
The biggest challenge I faced was refamiliarizing myself with the basic syntax and function of python. It has been a year and a half since I have done anything in python,
so I am very rusty. I was also nervous about making a test for this program as I have never done that in python, but the sample code was very helpful.

#### What did you think about the requirements specification for this assignment?
I thought the requirements for this assignment were very fair. I think it walks a good line of making us figure out what we were doing without leaving us stranded.

#### What challenges did you encounter with the tools?
I didn't encounter any issues with the tools.

#### Describe the criteria you used to determine that you had sufficient test cases, i.e. how did you know you were done?
I wasn't entirely sure how far I needed to go when programming the test cases. So I just created an equal to and not equal to test for each type of triangle.
